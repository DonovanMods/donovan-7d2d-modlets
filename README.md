# Donovan's 7 Days to Die Modlets

**A20 UPDATE!** All modlets have been updated to work in A20! Enjoy!

This is a collection of modlets I've made in order to enhance the "fun factor" of 7 Days to Die and most of them I would considered "Quality of Life" changes, but, of course, you're free to define them however you wish.

The modlets are all intended to be used a la carte, so you can freely mix and match the ones _you_ think will make your game more enjoyable. Any exceptions are noted in the descriptions below (some conflict with each other because they alter the same things in different ways).

Please see the README located in each of the modlet's directories for more details.

These are all available individually and are intended to work in unison, so feel free to mix and match to suit your needs, however, pay attention to any conflicts listed in the descriptions.

All have been verfied under game version: _Alpha 20 (stable)_

### AiO

The _All In One_ modlet is a bundle of modlets which _I personally_ recommend for the "best" experience, but they are all available individually, so feel free to mix and match should you desire.

Any modlets added after the AiO will overrule what's included in the AiO, esentially replacing the mod with a different one. e.g. `more*` vs `mega*` modlets. So you can start with AiO as your base and add additional ones to customize your experience.

## History

I previously used an excellent XML config replacement made by SpikeDaddy, so full credit to him for his work and my inspiration!

With the addition of xpath support to the game architecture, I decided to convert some of his changes along with a few of my own into a series of a-la-carte modlets. The result is this body of work, which will be updated with new ideas and to support future stable versions of 7D2D.

Enjoy!
