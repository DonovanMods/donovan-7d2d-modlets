# Donovan's 7 Days to Die Modlets

**A20 UPDATE!** All modlets have been updated to work in A20! Enjoy!

This is a collection of modlets I've made in order to enhance the "fun factor" of 7 Days to Die and most of them I would considered "Quality of Life" changes, but, of course, you're free to define them however you wish.

The modlets are all intended to be used a la carte, so you can freely mix and match the ones _you_ think will make your game more enjoyable. Any exceptions are noted in the descriptions below (some conflict with each other because they alter the same things in different ways).

Finally, the _All In One_ modlet is a compilation of those modlets which _I_ personally recommend. Please see the README located in that modlet's directory for a list of which modlets are included.

## The List

These are all intended to work in unison, so feel free to mix and match to suit your needs, however, pay attention to any conflicts listed in the descriptions.

## History

I previously used an excellent XML config replacement made by SpikeDaddy, so full credit to him for his work and my inspiration!

With the addition of xpath support to the game architecture, I decided to convert some of his changes along with a few of my own into a series of a-la-carte modlets. The result is this body of work, which will be updated with new ideas and to support future stable versions of 7D2D.

Enjoy!
