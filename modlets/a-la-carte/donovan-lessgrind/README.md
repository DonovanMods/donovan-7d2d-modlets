# Donovan LessGrind

## 7 Days 2 Die Modlet

This modlet increases the amount of resources obtained from many sources and also lowers the requirements for building some limited items. The intention is to lower the grind level of the game a bit, for those who don't enjoy that aspect as much.

Changes to recipes are minimal, but do includes things like:

- Most foods that use meat now have lower meat requirements.
- Iron bars now take 50% of the iron needed in vanilla (100 iron is a bit much for a single iron bar block).
- I know they give you more bone's for harvesting now, but you should still be able to make a bone knife with only one bone.
- Bird Nests will now give more eggs.
- Duct Tape now only requires 1 cloth fragment instead of 10.
- Medical Bandages now only require 2 cloth fragments instead of 10.
- Beakers are now craftable in the forge.
